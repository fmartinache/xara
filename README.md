# XARA: a python package for eXtreme Angular Resolution Astronomy

**XARA** is a python module that was initially designed to create, extract and manipulate Fourier-phase out of diffraction-dominated astronomical images, using the theory introduced by several journal papers:

- [Martinache (2010), ApJ, 724, 464](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...724..464M)
- [Martinache (2013), PASP, 125, 422](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PASP..125..422M)
- [Martinache et al (2020), A&A, 636, A72](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201936981)

Over the years, the package has been used by several graduate students, motivated by obsevring projects using a wide range of instruments (ground based adaptive optics assisted cameras as well as space borne instruments). The same students  have often made their own fork of the project.

## Tutorial/documentation

A documentation featuring several tutorial examples and a fair amount of howto explanation is available here: http://frantzmartinache.eu/xara_doc/

## Acknowledgement

From 2016 to 2022, the development of XARA was supported by the ERC KERNEL project is a development carried out in the context of the KERNEL project. KERNEL has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement CoG - 683029).
